# Unnamed platform game, title pending

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

Born as a project to follow a Udemy course, it's becoming a fully fledged game. May or may never become open source, after all the basic code is not mine as it comes from the course, though I added a lot of things.

The game only featured Big Vegas as a playable character, I added a dragon so it's both a Crash and a Spyro inspired game.
